    "## Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and details that do not generalize to new data. Consequences include poor performance on test data and inability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
    "- Simplify the model (e.g., fewer parameters).\n",
    "- Use more training data.\n",
    "- Apply regularization techniques.\n",
    "- Cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underfitting\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
    "- Increase model complexity (e.g., more parameters).\n",
    "- Improve feature engineering.\n",
    "- Reduce regularization.\n",
    "- Use a different model architecture.\n"

    "\n",
    "To reduce overfitting:\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Apply L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large coefficients.\n",
    "- **Pruning:** For decision trees, limit the depth or prune branches.\n",
    "- **Dropout:** In neural networks, randomly drop units during training.\n",
    "- **Early Stopping:** Stop training when performance on a validation set deteriorates.\n"
